# OctoAcme â€” RACI Matrix Template

## Purpose
Define clear accountability and responsibility for project activities using the RACI framework (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).

## RACI Definitions

- **R (Responsible)**: Person(s) who do the work to complete the task
- **A (Accountable)**: Person ultimately answerable for the task (only one A per task)
- **C (Consulted)**: People whose input is sought (two-way communication)
- **I (Informed)**: People kept up-to-date on progress (one-way communication)

## Using This Matrix

1. **Review quarterly**: Update the RACI matrix based on team structure changes or process improvements
2. **Customize per project**: Adjust role assignments based on project size and complexity
3. **Resolve conflicts**: If multiple people are Accountable (A) for one task, clarify ownership
4. **Fill gaps**: If no one is Responsible (R) or Accountable (A), assign ownership
5. **Communicate clearly**: Share the matrix with all team members during project kickoff
6. **Use in onboarding**: Reference this matrix when onboarding new team members

## Notes

- For small teams, one person may fill multiple roles (e.g., Project Manager and Scrum Master)
- Not all roles need to be involved in every activity - blank cells indicate no involvement
- Adjust this template based on your organization's structure and project needs
- This matrix works best when combined with clear role definitions in [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)
