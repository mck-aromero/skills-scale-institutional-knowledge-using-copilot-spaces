# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management framework! This collection of documents provides a comprehensive guide to how we plan, execute, and deliver successful projects.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five core principles:

- **Customer-first mindset**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments to provide continuous value
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead with defined responsibilities
- **Data-driven improvements**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage feedback, learning, and open communication

## Project Lifecycle

Our project lifecycle consists of five key phases:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish a high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks, and align timelines
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, review, and iterate with daily standups and regular progress reviews
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy features to production with proper verification and communication
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements
